[BCMS](https://thebcms.com) is a Headless CMS (Content Management System). It provides an intuitive content editor and a powerful API. The BCMS platform consists of 2 major parts: [BCMS Cloud](https://cloud.thebcms.com) and BCMS Instance. The BCMS Cloud is a platform that provides a way to create and manage BCMS instances. It is used for issuing BCMS Licenses, managing BCMS Instances, and providing tools for organizations to manage teams and permissions efficiently. BCMS is open-source and offers both free and paid plans.
